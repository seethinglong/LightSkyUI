Reactive MatchDay
------------------

**Reactive MatchDay** is a testing Java application that uses the following technology stack:

   * Thymeleaf 3.0 (`master`:`3.0.9.RELEASE`, `dev`:`3.0.10-SNAPSHOT`)
   * Spring Boot 2.0.0 (`master`:`2.0.0.M5`, `dev`:`2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`)
   * Spring Framework 5 (`master`:`5.0.0.RELEASE`, `dev`:`5.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`)
   * Spring WebFlux (`master`:`5.0.0.RELEASE`, `dev`:`5.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`)
   * Spring Data MongoDB (Reactive) (`master`:`2.0.0.RELEASE`, `dev`:`2.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`)
   * MongoDB (`3.4+`)

Highlights of this application are:

   * Use of Thymeleaf's integration module for Spring 5's WebFlux reactive web framework.
   * Use of Thymeleaf's data-driven support for rendering HTML in a reactive-friendly manner.
   * Use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) rendered in HTML by Thymeleaf from a reactive data stream.
   * Use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) rendered in JSON by Spring WebFlux from a reactive data stream.
   * Use of Spring Data MongoDB's reactive (Reactive Streams) driver support.
   * Use of Spring Data MongoDB's support for infinite reactive data streams based on MongoDB tailable cursors.
   * Use of Thymeleaf's fully-HTML5-compatible syntax
   * Use of many weird, randomly generated team and player names.


#### Running

First make sure MongoDB (3.4+) is running:

```
$ mongod [your options]
```

By default this application will expect MongoDB running on `localhost` with a default configuration
and no authentication, and it will create a database called `matchday` in your server. If you need
a different configuration you can adjust the connection at the Spring Boot `application.properties`
file in the app.

Once MongoDB is running, just execute from the project's folder:

```
$ mvn -U clean compile spring-boot:run
```

This should start the Spring Boot 2.0 + Spring 5 WebFlux managed Netty HTTP server on port 8080.
It also starts two **agents**, separate threads which insert random match events and match comments
into MongoDB collections (each n seconds) so that the web interface has some data to show.

Once started, point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`:

![Matchday: matches page](/doc/matchday_matches.png)

This first page presents a list of the (randomly generated) football matches that are currently being played in our
league. This list of matches is rendered by from a `@Controller` which includes a `Flux<MatchInfo>` 
object in the `Model`, then calls a Thymeleaf view to be rendered. Before actually rendering,
Spring WebFlux will fully resolve the `Flux` (non-blocking) so that Thymeleaf can iterate it.
 
If you click on *See Match*:

![Matchday: match page](/doc/matchday_match.png)

This page allows us to follow a specific match. 

On the left side, the current score and the
list of events is rendered by means of HTML Server-Sent Events (SSE) retrieved by an `EventSource`
JavaScript object, which calls a `@Controller` that retrieves the match events as a **MongoDB
tailable cursor** (see [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/tailable-cursors/)) in the
form of a `Flux<MatchEvent>`. This is put into the model as a Thymeleaf *data-driver context
variable* so that Thymeleaf can execute in a reactive-friendly manner and produce SSE events
rendered in HTML in a reactive way, as MongoDB notifies the application of the existence of
new events in the database. So it is MongoDB who effectively pushes its new data into the
application, triggering the rendering of a chunk of HTML and its sending to the browser, all of
this in a reactive, non-blocking manner.

On the right side, the comments for the match are retrieved in two steps: 

*1st* a list of the *comments so far* (until the moment the `@Controller` executes) are retrieved at the server side
and put into a Thymeleaf *data-driver context variable*, so that Thymeleaf renders them into HTML
in a *reactive-friendly* way (non-blocking) as they are returned by MongoDB. This is not a
 *tailable cursor*, so the query cursor actually completes. 
 
 *2nd*, once the list reaches the browser, another
`EventSource` JavaScript object performs a call to a different `@Controller`, which this
time collects the rest of the match comments (the ones generated after the moment the page
was rendered) in the form of another *tailable cursor*, and renders them in JSON (`@ResponseBody`).
This way MongoDB will be able to push new comments inserted by the *comments agent* directly
towards the browser in the form of JSON-rendered Server-Sent Events (SSE), which a bit of
JavaScript at the browser then will parse and insert into the Document Object Model.

---

**NOTE**: This demo application does not work (or style properly) in Microsoft IE/Edge, due to the lack of
support for `EventSource` in these browsers. Several polyfill options exist to palliate this, but they have
not been applied to this application for the sake of simplicity.
